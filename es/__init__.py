'''Helper package for making Elastic-Search queries in the context of ARIA

Much of the previous code had lots of cut-n-paste for handling the response(s)
from Elastic-Search(ES). The intent is to reduce that cut-n-paste code and work
from a common base here. By no means should this be considered the most
efficient or effective way to work with ES. It is simply a consolidation of
what was found in previous work without reference ES documenation at all.

However, if one was interested in making it more efficient or effective, then
this package would be the place to do that work.
